# LiveCode TextMate Bundle (v. 1.3.0)

This bundle is meant to be used for editing LiveCode script only stacks. It sends an update
notification over a datagram connection to LiveCode each time you save a livecodescript file
in TextMate using the appropriate key equivalent **⌃⌘S**. Use a stack in LiveCode accepting
datagram connections to be notified about script updates or use the [Levure Application Framework](https://github.com/trevordevore/levure), 
see note below.

## Features

-   Script error checking ("linting"), key equivalent is **⌃⇧V**
-   Update notification
-   Collapsing Text Blocks (Foldings)
-   Handler Pop-up
-   Code Completion
-   Snippets with Tab Stops and Placeholders
-   TextMate Commands using the server engine (your PATH variable needs to include
    		the path to the LiveCode server directory)
-   Indentation
-   Paired Characters

## Requirements

-   LiveCode Server version ≥ 6.6.0
    You can download LiveCode Server at <https://downloads.livecode.com/livecode>.
    Install it somewhere appropriate.

## Installation

-   Download the zip from GitHub, unzip it
-   Change the file name from "LiveCode.tmbundle-master" to "LiveCode.tmbundle"
-   You can install the bundle by placing it in ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/.
    The ~ character in this path refers to your home directory.
-   To use LiveCode specific TextMate **commands** and to enable **linting** add the
    	server directory to the PATH variable in TextMate settings like:
      Variable Name:
      PATH
      Value:
      $PATH:/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin:/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/LiveCodeServer
    	Adjust the path to your needs.
    Add a variable "TM\_livecode\_explicit\_vars" to TextMate settings and set it to "true" or "false".


**Please rename your server engine to: livecode-server, even if you use the pro version.**

As a start choose "LiveCode" or "LiveCodeDark" from View > Theme and "LiveCode Server" from the language pop-up in TextMate.
See what happens if you type "com" ( write a LiveCode handler) and hit tab consecutively.

**Note:** If you use the [Levure Application Framework](https://github.com/trevordevore/levure), for update notifications to work you need
to replace the Levure script "external_editor_server.livecodescript" in levure/utils/external_editor_server/
of your  Levure project with the one included in the bundle.

### Update

Replace the appropriate file in ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/
with the downloaded LiceCode.tmbundle file.

## Linting

Use the key equivalent **⌃⇧V** for script error checking.

**Note:** The linter code adapted to TextMate was taken from the [LiveCode language package for Atom](https://github.com/peter-b/atom-language-livecode).
